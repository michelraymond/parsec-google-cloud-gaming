# Parsec + Google Cloud Gaming PC

### What is this?

This repo sets you up to play games like [Doom Eternal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/) on your own laptop! You can play with all graphics set to max since you'll be streaming the screen from a beefy gaming PC in Google Cloud.

We just need to set up two things:

- [A Parsec account](https://parsecgaming.com/). This lets us stream the screen from the server at super low latency. It's like [Google Stadia](https://store.google.com/product/stadia?gclid=CjwKCAjwguzzBRBiEiwAgU0FT7GirMrN5XiJOHrRMcFNXx6Y1a3BGxoZ2mX1wEKSO5e-3urfE4NeoxoCwd8QAvD_BwE) but better, in my humble opinion.
- A Google Cloud virtual machine with a [Telsa P100 GPU](https://www.microway.com/knowledge-center-articles/comparison-of-nvidia-geforce-gpus-and-nvidia-tesla-gpus/) running Windows Server 2019
  - If you haven't signed up for Google Cloud before, you get **$300 in credits for free!**
  - The virtual machine **costs about $1.30/hour** to run. Don't worry about getting overcharged ‚Äî we'll set up your machine to shut down automatically when you're done playing

### Guide

This should take about 30 minutes to set up. Could take longer depending on how fast Google responds to you via email after step 4.

1. [Sign up for Google Cloud.](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/) Choose the Google account you'll want to get your bill under.
1. Once you're at the main Google Cloud console page ([console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/)), let's create a new Project
   1. Click `My First Project` at the top of the page
        ![a](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/vduxhpl4dgwnhw5/Screenshot%202020-03-25%2020.28.47.png?dl=0)
   1. Click `NEW PROJECT` at the top-right of the modal
   1. Call your new project `Parsec`
   1. Wait until your new project has finished creating
   1. **Important:** Use the same button to change to your new `Parsec` project. If you do this correctly, you should see this:
        ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1i3u6zdj2y3vuqj/Screenshot%202020-03-28%2018.26.03.png?dl=0)
1. Using the search bar up top, search `vm instances` and click the result labeled "Instances"
       ![b](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0uzkuqcssfim1oa/Screenshot%202020-03-25%2020.36.46.png?dl=0)
   1. You'll be brought to a screen saying
   
        > Compute Engine is getting ready.
        
      Wait for this message to go away ‚Äî this should take a few minutes.
   1. Click `Create` __but don't do anything else__. Move on to the next step.
1. Request an increase to your GPU quota. We need to ask Google Cloud to let us create a machine with a GPU attached.
   1. In the search bar up top, search `all quotas` and click the result
        ![c](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/zv6wwj4narkxr1l/Screenshot%202020-03-25%2020.34.11.png?dl=0)
   1. Under the dropdowns, you'll see a banner asking you to upgrade your account. Once again, **make sure that your active project is the `Parsec` project.** If it is, click "Upgrade Account" (twice), then refresh the page
        ![d](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4sj1brjrw158i40/Screenshot%202020-03-25%2020.42.21.png?dl=0)
   1. Click the dropdown for `Metrics` and click `None` to deselect everything.
   1. Search `GPUs all` and select the only option
       ![e](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/75ffmx4b909dtw3/Screenshot%202020-03-25%2020.40.45.png?dl=0)
   1. Click the checkbox on the only result in the list, then click "Edit Quotas" at the top of the page
       ![f](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/l75j4wqeqcjy608/Screenshot%202020-03-25%2020.43.49.png?dl=0)
   1. In the right-side drawer:
      - Fill out your info and click "Next"
      - Request a new quota of `1` (up from zero) and provide a request description ‚Äî be creative ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
      - Click "Done" on the **small box first**, and then click "Submit Request"
   1. Google now has to approve your quota increase. They'll send you an email when they confirm. This may take a while, but in practice it takes less than an hour. Move on to the next step while you wait.

1. [Download and install Parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/). Open Parsec and make an account. You'll eventually need to sign in on the cloud machine as well, so **remember your username+password**!
1. [Download and install VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/). You will this later to set up GPU and display settings using remote desktop on your cloud machine.
1. Download the default Service Account key. This will give Terraform permission to create your machine later in step 9.
    1. [Go back to the Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    1. Search `credentials` at the top and click "APIs & Services"
        ![g](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0ussa3kfm19aa42/Screenshot%202020-03-25%2020.48.26.png?dl=0)
    1. In the left-hand drawer, click "Credentials"
    1. Under the "Service Accounts" section, click the one named "Compute Engine default service account"

    1. Click "Create Key" at the bottom, choose JSON
    1. Save the key as `account.json` to root of this repo
1. Wait until Google Cloud approves your GPU quota increase from step 4.
1. Create the virtual machine. You'll need to open the Terminal for this step.

    **‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è** This step will start your cloud machine and **you will start getting charged!** Don't stop following the guide here, or make sure to stop the machine before leaving!!!
   1. In the Google Cloud console, copy your project ID from the dropdown at the top.
